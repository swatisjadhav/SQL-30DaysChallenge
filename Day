--Write a solution to find all the authors that viewed at least one of their own articles.Return the result table sorted by id in ascending order.
--How to use SELECT, DISTINCT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY

--Problem Analysis: 
*  We need to find all authors [author_id].
*  Who viewed their own article  at least one [distinct/unique].
*  This means here we are checking for ids where the viewer_id (viewer) is the same as the author_id (author).
*  finally,Sort ids[author_id] in acending order.

--Solution:

SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id 
FROM views 
WHERE author_id = viewer_id 
ORDER BY author_id ;
