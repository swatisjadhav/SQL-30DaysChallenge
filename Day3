--Problem Statement:
3.	Write a solution to find managers with at least five direct reports.
Return the result table in any order.

--Problem Analysis:
-Here we have employee table with id,name,department,managerid.
-Managerid is null that means that employee donâ€™t have any manager.
-Employee is not manager of themselves.
-Its one table but we have to do comparision between two columns so will go for self join to compare id and managerid.
-Further find count of managers and filter them with given condition.
-Here we have to put condition on aggregated data so will go with having clause.
-but before filtering that data we need to group that column using group by clause.

--Solution:
SELECT e1.name 
FROM employee e1 JOIN employee e2 
ON e1.id =e2.managerId
GROUP BY e2.managerId
HAVING count(e2.managerId)>=5;
